				<info>Lie on the stomach with your palms flat on the floor under your shoulders. \n\nThe heels are together with the soles of the feet facing up. \n\nInhale into cobra pose, arching the spine, vertebra by vertebra, from the neck to the base of the spine until the arms are straight with the elbows locked. \n\nAlternatively leave your underarms on the floor in what we call Spfinx pose.\n\nBegin breath of fire or long deep breathing.\n\nTime: 1-3 minutes. \n\nTo end: Inhale, arch the spine to the maximum. Exhale and hold the breath out briefly, apply the root lock and relax.\n\nThis exercise opens up the chest and reduces tension, stress and fatigue within the body. \n\nIt strengthens and tones the back muscles and tissues along the vertebrae, therefore relieving any tension, aches and pains in the lower back.</info>

			<title>Mental Balance Meditation - Kirtan kriya</title>
			<info>Sit straight in Easy Pose. \n\nEyes: Meditate at the Brow Point. \n\nMantra: Produce the five primal sounds (panj shabd):
                S, T, N, M, A, in the original word form: \n\nSAA: Infinity, cosmos, beginning  \nTAA: Life, existence \nNAA: Death, change, transformation \nMAA: Rebirth \n\nEach repetition of the entire mantra takes 3 to 4 seconds. \n\nThis is the cycle of Creation. From the Infinite comes life and individual existence. From life comes death or change. From death comes the rebirth of consciousnes to the joy of the Infinite through which compassion leads back to life. \n\nMudra: This mantra can be done in many different mudras. Most common is to begin in Gyan Mudra. The elbows are straight while chanting, and the mudra changes as each fingertip touches in turn the tip of the thumb with firm pressure. \n\nOn SAA, touch the first (Jupiter) finger. \n\nOn TAA, touch the second (Saturn) finger. \n\nOn NAA, touch the third (Sun) finger. \n\nOn MAA, touch the fourth (Mercury) finger. \n\nChant in three languages of consicousness: \n\nHuman: normal or loud voice (the world)  \nLovers: strong whisper (longing to belong)  \nDivine: mentally; silent (Infinity) \n\nTime: Begin the kriya in a normal voice for 5 minutes; then whisper for 5 minutes; then go deep into the sound, vibrating silently for 10 minutes. Then come back to a whisper for 5 minutes, then aloud for 5 minutes. \n\nThe duration of the meditation may vary, as long as the proportion of loud, whisper, silent, whisper, loud is maintained. \n\nTo End: This sequence will take 30 minutes. Follow with one 1 minute of stretching the arms over your head and spreading the fingers wide, shaking them out, circulating the energy, inhaling and exhaling 3 times.\n\nRelax.

			<info>Sit in Easy Pose with a straight spine. \n\nInterlock all of your fingers except your ring fingers, which are pressed together pointing upward. \n\nThe right thumb locks down the left thumb. \n\nPlace the mudra at diaphragm level, several inches out from the body, with the fingers pointing out at a sixty-degree angle. \n\nClose your eyes.\n\nInhale deeply and chant "Ong" in long form, one recitation of "Ong" per exhalation. \n\nThe sound is created through the nose; although the mouth is held slightly open, no air comes through the mouth. \n\nThe sound comes from the nose by way of the back of the upper palate. Your upper palate will vibrate, concentrate to do it correctly. \n\nTime: Repeat minimum 5 times.</info>

			<title>Tune in</title>
			<info>In Kundalini Yoga we tune in with the mantra: ONG NAMO GURU DEV NAMO.The mantra means: I bow to the Creative Wisdom, I bow to the Divine Teacher within. \n\nEverything in the universe is made of energy, vibrating at various frequencies. \n\nChanting mantras is not singing or speaking, it is vibrating. Mantras are combinations of syllables that allow us to connect with specific levels of consciousness, affecting the patterns of the mind and chemistry of the brain. \n\nHow to tune in: Sit with your spine straight, preferably cross-legged on the floor. Pull your chin back slightly. Place the palms of the hands together at the centre of the chest, fingers pointing upward, thumbs lightly pressing on the sternum. \n\nClose your eyes and keep your focus at the centre of your forehead. Take a few long deep breaths through the nose. \n\nChant ONG NAMO GURU DEV NAMO at least three times or as many times as you wish until you feel ‘connected.</info>
